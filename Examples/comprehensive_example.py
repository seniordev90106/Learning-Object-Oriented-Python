"""
This is a comprehensive example of classes, instantiating its objects
inside another class, and using its properties, static variables and static methods

What this example demonstrates:
- Idea of class, object, static / class variables, properties
Instructions:
- Create the classes Student, Teacher, Course, Degree and Program.
- Each class should have a variable for the no. of students, teachers, courses, degrees and programs respectively
- The private members of the class should be encapsulated via properties
- The Course class should be able to hold the number of students enrolled in that specific course
- Similarly, the Degree class should hold the number of courses and the Program class should hold the number of degrees
- Instantiate 4 students, 4 teachers, 2 courses to demonstrate the use of classes in this context
- At the end of this exercise, display the total number of students, teachers and courses, the name of
  students enrolled in each course.
